# RoboFriends App

This is an app of contact cards of robot friends searchable with their names. I fetch the robots from the [Robohash](https://robohash.org) website 
and I feed the API for the users from [Typicode](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users). I then use React to create contact cards for the robots
and create a searchable component for the robot users. I am still learning React so this is my first project. Hope you enjoy it!
